# Avail: Real-Time Availability Display Solution

## Product Overview

Avail is a streamlined solution that allows organizations to display real-time availability to clients without requiring complex booking infrastructure. The system provides two flexible deployment options to meet diverse business needs.

## Deployment Methods

### 1. Website Widget

An embeddable component that organizations can add to their existing websites with a simple code snippet. The widget displays real-time availability directly on the organization's website.

**Key Features:**
- One-line installation with customizable appearance
- Real-time calendar synchronization
- Mobile responsive design
- Clear call-to-action buttons for booking/contact
- Seamless integration with existing websites

### 2. Standalone Availability Page

A dedicated page accessible via a direct link (similar to Linktree) for sharing on social media, email signatures, or anywhere a direct website embed isn't possible.

**Key Features:**
- Custom branded URL (username.avail.com)
- Shareable link for social media profiles
- No website required for the organization
- Analytics tracking

## Calendar Integration

The solution synchronizes with existing calendar and scheduling systems:
- Google Calendar
- Microsoft Outlook/365
- Apple Calendar
- Popular scheduling tools (Calendly, Acuity, etc.)

## Value Proposition
